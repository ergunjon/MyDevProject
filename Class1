Jenkins:
what are servers ? Whey we need them?
1. Stay power on all the time()
2. Strong internet connection(in GBps) all the time
3. A lot of resources like RAM Disk etc
=========================================================
1. Developers will develop the code
2. Runs the unit tests if everything goes well
ask the DevOps person to build that code on Dev servers
3. Developer verifies that code on Dev server
4. Request to DevOps person to deploy it on the integration server
5. Tester will ask DevOps person to deploy the code to QA server
6. Tester may ask again DevOps person deploy it on the Performance server, Security testing servers
7. DevOps person deploy application on Staging servers (replica of production server) UAT server on which UAT is performed.
8. To production server
Issues in the manual Testing/Deployment
1. Time consuming
2. if multiple developers are working there can be issues in build and to fix those issues we may
need to look all of the newly added code
3. No Automation means a lot of manual effort
